# Civilisations

## Game Rules

The goal of the game is to develop your civilization and conquer enemy territories using your hero and various unit cards.  

### Setup

The players choose a civilisation, and a heroe in the same time.  
Once this step is completed, the players have to take one of the three decks.  
Every deck matche with a game strategy : attacker, farmer or researcher.  
Your gameplay doesn't have to be exactly the same but will be influenced.  

### Game progress

The rounds are divided in 3 steps :  
> The draw to have three cards in your hand  
> The choice of the cards you will place in the action place  
> The action : skip, farm or attack  

The draw give to the player random cards in his deck for him to have three cards.  
During the choice, the player can put down unites, use some technologies or just wait.  
The last step of the round, the action, let the player choose to wait, attack or farm with the unites in the action place.  
  
If the player attack, his unites will stay lose life proportionally at the enemy's castle, and fight all adverse unites in the board.  
The attack can also be a defense, because the attackers have to kill every hostile in their way to reach the adverse castle.  
The farm will take one round, and return ressources for every farmer who get the castle during the next round.  
If a farmer died, he don't return any ressource, but a farmer with attack points can defend himself.  
The skip let your action place like it is, so you could add new troops the next round.
